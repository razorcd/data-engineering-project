## Week 4 Homework - WIP

In this homework, we'll enhance the alreeady presented dbt project using the already loaded Taxi data from 2019 and 2020 in our DWH.

In this homework, we will:

* Build a source table
* Build a fact table
* Create a dashboard 

If you don't have access to GCP, you can do this locally using the ingested data from your Postgres database
instead. If you have access to GCP, you don't need to do it for local Postgres -
only if you want.
